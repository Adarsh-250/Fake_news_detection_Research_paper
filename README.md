> **Overview:** This repository contains the source code and the final research paper for the detection of fake news using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project utilizes TF-IDF vectorization alongside various machine learning classifiers to accurately classify news articles as legitimate or fake.

## 📂 Repository Components

As per the evaluation requirements, this repository contains:
* 📄 **Report:** `Research_Paper.pdf` - The final published/submitted research paper.
* 💻 **Source Code:** * `baseline_models.py`: Script to train and evaluate Baseline ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
  * `generate_metrics.py`: Script to train and evaluate the Passive Aggressive Classifier.
* 📊 **Datasets:** Required `.csv` files (linked below).

## 💾 Dataset Installation (Important)

Due to GitHub's file size limits, the datasets are hosted externally on Google Drive. You must download them before running the code.

1. **Download the Data:** Click [this Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LaTPNj8HdWASmIPh6iVEJsKDPPXd3i9b?usp=sharing) to access the datasets.
2. **Extract:** Download both `True.csv` and `Fake.csv`.
3. **Placement:** Move both downloaded `.csv` files directly into the same folder as your Python scripts.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Setup

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. 

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Fake-News-Detection-NLP.git](https://github.com/yourusername/Fake-News-Detection-NLP.git)
cd Fake-News-Detection-NLP
2. Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. NLTK Stopwords Setup:
The scripts require the NLTK stopwords dataset to clean the text. Run this quick Python snippet to ensure it is downloaded:

Python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
🚀 Running the Project
1️⃣ Baseline Models Evaluation
Train the Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM models. This script handles text preprocessing (URL removal, HTML tag stripping, and stopword removal) before running the TF-IDF vectorizer.

Bash
python baseline_models.py
2️⃣ Passive Aggressive Classifier Evaluation
Train the primary PAC model to generate a detailed classification report and confusion matrix.

Bash
python generate_metrics.py
